There are now packages for PPM available as well! See below the bits on 
installation to learn how to install those.

Mail::MboxParser is a module for working with UNIX-flavoured mailboxes.
This document describes version 0.40.

Its purpose is to _easily_ extract messages from a mailbox with _simple_ 
access to header fields, body and MIME-parts. It is for those people who 
find the above two module-sets too confusing and heavy-weighted. See the 
list of provided methods below.
It is particularly easy to deal with any kind of attached files. See the 
supplied store_att.pl script for an example. 

Prerequisites:
--------------

    + MIME::Tools (probably >= 5.0)
    + MIME::QuotedPrint (don't know which version)
    
    optional:
    + Mail::Mbox::MessageParser (highly recommended!)
    + URI::Find if you want to use Mail::MboxParser::Mail::Body->extract_urls

Installation:
-------------

    'make'-enabled systems:
    -----------------------
    Un'tar xfz' the module and 'cd' into the new directory 
    Mail-MboxParser-$VERSION.

    Then install:
        perl Makefile.PL
        make
        make test
        make install

    Win-users having an 'nmake' installed can also do the above, given the
    fact they replace 'make' with 'nmake' in the above list.

    Win-systems:
    ------------
    I was made aware that ActiveState now turns CPAN additions into
    PPM distributions automatically. However, this may not happen when
    their build system enounters some problems. I'll simply assume that
    Mail::MboxParser wont make problems but I can't be sure. If it turns
    out that there is no PPM dist available of the current version of this
    module, please contact me by mail and I will create one and make it
    publically available.
   
    Therefore, first try to install it from the default repository of
    ActiveState. If it doesn't provide the most current release, try 
    instead:
    
    ppm> set repository sourceforge http://mail-mboxparser.sourceforge.net/ 
    ppm> search Mail-MboxParser             <== optional!
    ppm> install Mail-MboxParser-$VERSION
         [or possibly just:
         install Mail-MboxParser
         ]
    
    If that wont yield anything either, contact me.
    
Autoloader:
-----------
Read the Mail::MboxParser::Mail docs for invoking external methods.
The autoloading-mechanism will take care that the below and other things
will work:

	$mail->effective_type; # from MIME::Entity

Have a look into the eg-directory of the package for some (or one) example(s).

Contact:
--------
Bugs, feature requests, questions, comments etc. should be directly 
mailed to me.
