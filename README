Mail::MboxParser is a module for working with UNIX-flavoured mailboxes.
This document describes version 0.54.

Its purpose is to _easily_ extract messages from a mailbox with _simple_ 
access to header fields, body and MIME-parts.  It is particularly easy to 
deal with any kind of attached files. See the supplied store_att.pl script 
for an example. 

Prerequisites:
--------------

    + MIME::Tools (probably >= 5.0)
    + MIME::QuotedPrint (don't know which version)
    
    optional:
    + Mail::Mbox::MessageParser (highly recommended but not necessary)
    + URI::Find if you want to use Mail::MboxParser::Mail::Body->extract_urls
    + Encode (standard module for >= perl5.8.0)

Installation:
-------------

Un'tar xfz' the module and 'cd' into the new directory 
Mail-MboxParser-$VERSION.

Then install:
    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

Win-users having an 'nmake' installed can also do the above, given the
fact they replace 'make' with 'nmake' in the above list.

Contact:
--------
Bugs, feature requests, questions, comments etc. should be directly 
mailed to me.
